# oneRepMaxCalculator-C-Sharp
This is a one rep max calculator using the Epley formula


Epley formulas is 1rm = w(1 +r/30)
I refactored the eqaution so that I did not have any parenthesises, and basically just distrubuted w into the equation
my new equation is just 1rm = w+w*r/30 now. and that is what I ended up coding. I might expand this so that it will have a two rep max, and three rep and so on
